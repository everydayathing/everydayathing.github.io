Dear Internet,

The whole kitchen was clean when I woke up this morning. Because I cleaned it the night before. A nice surprise. Felt like waking up with maid service. I get the same happy feeling everytime I change my sheets. I guess I have housecleaning amnesia. It's almost as good as movie amnesia. I can never remember how movies end so every time it's like, "surprise! the boat sinks! and only one of them survived!" I am always so hopeful it will work out.

related: I will never go on a cruise.

Why do I balk at spending 6 money units on grape tomatoes, but then I turn around and spend 6 money units on a box of cookies?  Obviously cookies are more delicious and you don't have to worry that they might not taste good. But really what I am saying is, I'm too cheap to eat properly, would rather get diabetes, and also be poor because apparently I don't understand how money works.

Yours truly,

Me.
